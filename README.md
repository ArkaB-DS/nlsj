# nlsj

An attempt to refactor the `nls()` (base R) functionality, this is an interim package for exploration of ideas and will NOT, as it currently is presented, become a distributed package.

This package was developed during the `Google Summer of Code (GSoC), 2021` program, where the project student was **Arkajyoti Bhattacharjee** and the project mentors were **Dr. John C. Nash** and **Dr. Heather Turner**.

The GSoC project titled [`Improvements to nls()`](https://github.com/ArkaB-DS/GSOC21-improveNLS). 

## Installation
To install this development repository via `devtools` in **R** use:

```
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ArkaB-DS/nlsj")
```
